/**
 * SECTION:summer-transfer-speed
 * @short_description: Utility for tracking transfer speeds
 * @stability: Private
 *
 * This object lets you track transfer speeds. It works by letting you add a
 * number of datapoints with #summer_transfer_speed_add_datapoint, and then
 * lets you retrieve the average speed for the last few data points by calling
 * #summer_transfer_speed_get.
 *
 * The object works with circular buffers: as you add more data points, the
 * oldest ones will be overwritten. You should thus not call
 * #summer_transfer_speed_add_datapoint too often, or the average will be
 * calculated over a very short time period, making the result unreliable.
 *
 * Note that #SummerTransferSpeed is not reference counted, and all object must
 * thus manually be destroyed with #summer_transfer_speed_destroy.
