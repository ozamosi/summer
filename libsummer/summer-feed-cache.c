/**
 * SECTION:summer-feed-cache
 * @short_description: Interface for implementing feed cachers
 * @stability: Unstable
 *
 * This component contains an interface for implementing feed cacher.
 *
 * A feed cacher is a class that will keep track of what feed items has
 * previously been processed, that is, make sure files are only downloaded once.
 * It will need to keep track of this information during a session, as well as
 * between restarts of the application.
 *
 * Applications may want to store extra information on a per-download basis, in
 * which case it could write a custom feed cacher to store this information
 * with the cache information.
 *
 * A feed cache object needs to be a singleton. The method
 * %summer_feed_cache_set exists to set the feed cache. This method needs to be
 * called right at the application startup, before any feeds have been processed
 * or downloads completed. All subsequent calls to %summer_feed_cache_get will
 * then return a pointer to this object. If %summer_feed_cache_set is not
 * called before %summer_feed_cache_get, %summer_feed_cache_get will create and
 * return an instance of the default feed cache.
